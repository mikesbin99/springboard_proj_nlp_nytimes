# Springboard Capstone Three 
## NY Times Article Density Predicition using spaCy and LightGBM


This capstone project is a modeling exercise on the engagement of customers on NY Times Articles, namely, to separate and classify a binary outcome of whether an article has high or low engagement based on the article features.  I used the gradient boosting library of LightGBM to predict a binary outcome of this engagement, as well as Spacy to extract key entity and part of speech from given article keywords as well as subject based features in my model.
