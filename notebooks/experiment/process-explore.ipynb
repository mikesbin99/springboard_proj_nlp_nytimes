I'd say that the Board is exaggerating because it wants to win over the working class and show them that it has creds.  The working class knows first hand about these colleges and is well aware that the Board is posturing and is offended by the condescension. The Board underestimates the working class and the working class will have nothing to do with it.  No creds, no way.\n",
      "The legal thriller author John Grisham writes about for-profit law schools (The Rooster Bar) that prey upon prospective law students thru their access to federally guaranteed student loans—a mirror of this veterans-Ed scam:  find a vulnerable population and exploit the federal program designed to help it.  We the people are left paying the tab for these sham schools that exploit loopholes to get rich.\n",

A prestigious research group did the homework and found that they are a mixed bag., no better, no worse.  So why are admittedly so-so colleges being smeared as pervasive scams when most are legit?  It's hard to say.  But there is no question that non-profits and publics spend millions upon millions in lobbying expenses.  Higher education is a multi-billion dollar industry which promotes its interests with its  huge purse.  And, with all the spending, nothing could serve their interests more  than getting rid of non-profits.\n",
